| ---------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| endpoint | `string`    | **Required:** endpoint for link data fetching. |

## Output data

This Tool returns `data` with following format:

| Field          | Type      | Description                     |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |

        "meta" : {
            "title" : "CodeX Team",
            "site_name" : "CodeX",
            "description" : "Club of web-development, design and marketing. We build team learning how to build full-valued projects on the world market.",
            "image" : {
                "url" : "https://codex.so/public/app/img/meta_img.png"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Backend response format <a name="server-format"></a>

You can implement backend for link data fetching your own way. It is a specific and trivial task depending on your
environment and stack.

Backend response **should** cover following format:

```json5
{
    "success" : 1,
    "meta": {
        // ... any fields you want
    }
}
```

**success** — uploading status. 1 for successful, 0 for failed

**link** — pasted link can be updated (e.g. after redirects)

**meta** — link fetched data

Currently **link**, **title**, **image** and **description** fields are supported by plugin's design. They should have the following format in the response:
```json5
{
    "success" : 1,
    "link": "https://codex.so",
    "meta": {
        "title" : "CodeX Team",
        "description" : "Club of web-development, design and marketing. We build team learning how to build full-valued projects on the world market.",
        "image" : {
            "url" : "https://codex.so/public/app/img/meta_img.png"
        }
    }
}
```
Also, can contain any additional fields you want to store.
